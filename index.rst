Introduction
------------

Your UnitedHealthcare (UHC) card is more than just an insurance card — it’s your key to accessing quality healthcare services, prescription benefits, and wellness programs. Whether you’ve just received your new card or are setting it up online, this step-by-step guide will help you activate and use your UHC card easily through activate.uhc.com.

What is a UHC Card?
--------------------

A UnitedHealthcare (UHC) card is given to all UHC insurance members. It contains important information such as your member ID number, plan type, and coverage details. You’ll need this card every time you visit a doctor, pharmacy, or hospital to verify your insurance benefits and billing details.
